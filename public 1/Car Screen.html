        <p class="para">There are many pieces to the puzzle of equipment that is the car air conditioner, but one vital
            component of
            your vehicle’s cool air system is the air-conditioning condenser. A/C condenser is a radiator positioned
            between the car’s grille and the radiator for the motor. In the condenser, the gaseous refrigerant sheds
            hea't and returns to a liquid state. In other words, the condenser condenses the refrigerant from a gas to a
            liquid.</p>

        <p class="para">The radiator is a heat exchanger used to remove heat from the coolant in the cooling system to
            prevent your
            vehicle's engine from overheating. Hot coolant is routed through the radiator, where the coolant can
            exchange heat with the passing air.

            For general maintenance on your radiator, check your coolant levels twice a year. Replacing a radiator can
            take most of the day, but is a doable DIY job. If you need to replace your radiator, use AutoZone's how to
            guide to get the job done right. Additionally, you should reference your vehicle's repair manual, as each
            vehicle is slightly different
            The AC Compressor is responsible for pumping coolant throughout your system and starting the process of
            cooling your car. Without it, the AC system will not work. Summer heats show that your vehicle's AC system
            is essential, so AutoZone has put together advice on how your AC works and how to recharge your AC if it is
            not working.</p>

    <h1  id="h1"><i>Bicycle</i></h1>

    <img src="Download Pick.jpg" />

    <p class="para">A bicycle, also called a pedal cycle, bike or cycle, is a human-powered or motor-powered assisted,
        pedal-driven, single-track vehicle, having two wheels attached to a frame, one behind the other. A bicycle rider
        is called a cyclist, or bicyclist.

        Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century in Europe. By the early 21st century, more than 1 billion were in
        existence.[1][2][3] These numbers far exceed the number of cars, both in total and ranked by the number of
        individual models produced.[4][5][6] They are the principal means of transportation in many regions. They also
        provide a popular form of recreation, and have been adapted for use as children's toys, general fitness,
        military and police applications, courier services, bicycle racing, and bicycle stunts.

        The basic shape and configuration of a typical upright or "safety bicycle", has changed little since the first
        chain-driven model was developed around 1885.[7][8][9] However, many details have been improved, especially
        since the advent of modern materials and computer-aided design. These have allowed for a proliferation of
        specialized designs for many types of cycling.

        The bicycle's invention has had an enormous effect on society, both in terms of culture and of advancing modern
        industrial methods. Several components that played a key role in the development of the automobile were
        initially invented for use in the bicycle, including ball bearings, pneumatic tires, chain-driven sprockets and
        tension-spoked wheels.[10]

        Although bike and cycle are used interchangeably to refer mostly to two types of two-wheelers, the terms still
        vary across the world. In India, for example, a cycle[11] refers only to a two-wheeler using pedal power whereas
        the term bike is used to describe a two-wheeler using internal combustion engine or electric motors as a source
        of motive power instead of motorcycle/motorbike.</p>

    <h1  id="h2"><i>Types</i></h1>
    <img src="Download types.png">
    <p class="para">Bicycles can be categorized in many different ways: by function, by number of riders, by general
        construction, by gearing or by means of propulsion. The more common types include utility bicycles, mountain
        bicycles, racing bicycles, touring bicycles, hybrid bicycles, cruiser bicycles, and BMX bikes. Less common are
        tandems, low riders, tall bikes, fixed gear, folding models, amphibious bicycles, cargo bikes, recumbents and
        electric bicycles.

        Unicycles, tricycles and quadracycles are not strictly bicycles, as they have respectively one, three and four
        wheels, but are often referred to informally as "bikes" or "cycles".</p>

    <h1  id="h3"><i>Accessories</i></h1>

    <img src="Download acc.JPG" />

    <p class="para">Some components, which are often optional accessories on sports bicycles, are standard features on
        utility bicycles to enhance their usefulness, comfort, safety and visibility. Fenders with spoilers (mudflaps)
        protect the cyclist and moving parts from spray when riding through wet areas. In some countries (e.g. Germany,
        UK), fenders are called mudguards. The chainguards protect clothes from oil on the chain while preventing
        clothing from being caught between the chain and crankset teeth. Kick stands keep bicycles upright when parked,
        and bike locks deter theft. Front-mounted baskets, front or rear luggage carriers or racks, and panniers mounted
        above either or both wheels can be used to carry equipment or cargo. Pegs can be fastened to one, or both of the
        wheel hubs to either help the rider perform certain tricks, or allow a place for extra riders to stand, or
        rest.[citation needed] Parents sometimes add rear-mounted child seats, an auxiliary saddle fitted to the
        crossbar, or both to transport children. Bicycles can also be fitted with a hitch to tow a trailer for carrying
        cargo, a child, or both.
        Toe-clips and toestraps and clipless pedals help keep the foot locked in the proper pedal position and enable
        cyclists to pull and push the pedals. Technical accessories include cyclocomputers for measuring speed,
        distance, heart rate, GPS data etc. Other accessories include lights, reflectors, mirrors, racks, trailers,
        bags, water bottles and cages, and bell.[59] Bicycle lights, reflectors, and helmets are required by law in some
        geographic regions depending on the legal code. It is more common to see bicycles with bottle generators,
        dynamos, lights, fenders, racks and bells in Europe. Bicyclists also have specialized form fitting and high
        visibility clothing.
        Children's bicycles may be outfitted with cosmetic enhancements such as bike horns, streamers, and spoke
        beads.[60] Training wheels are sometimes used when learning to ride.
        Bicycle helmets can reduce injury in the event of a collision or accident, and a suitable helmet is legally
        required of riders in many jurisdictions. Helmets may be classified as an accessory[59] or as an item of
        clothing.[61]
        Bike trainers are used to enable cyclists to cycle while the bike remains stationary. They are frequently used
        to warm up before races or indoors when riding conditions are unfavorable.[62]</p>

    <h1  id="h4"><i>History</i></h1>

    <img src="download his.jpg" />
    <p class="para">The "dandy horse",[19] also called Draisienne or Laufmaschine ("running machine"), was the first
        human means of transport to use only two wheels in tandem and was invented by the German Baron Karl von Drais.
        It is regarded as the first bicycle, but it did not have pedals;[20][21][22][23] Drais introduced it to the
        public in Mannheim in 1817 and in Paris in 1818.[24][25] Its rider sat astride a wooden frame supported by two
        in-line wheels and pushed the vehicle along with his or her feet while steering the front wheel.[24]</p>

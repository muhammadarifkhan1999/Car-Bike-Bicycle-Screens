            <h1 id="h1"><i>Motorcycle</i></h1>
            <img src="download bk.jfif" />

            <p class="para">A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, cycle, or (if three-wheeled) trike, is a two-
                or three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different
                purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport (including racing), and off-road riding.
                Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and being involved in other related social activity such as joining
                a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.

                The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first
                internal combustion, petroleum-fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & Wolfmüller became the first
                series production motorcycle.[4][5]

                Globally, motorcycles are comparably popular to cars as a method of transport. In 2021, approximately
                58.6 million new motorcycles were sold around the world,[6] fewer than the 66.7 million cars sold over
                the same period.[7]

                In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from
                Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India).[8] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian
                due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the
                Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.</p>

            <h1 id="h2"><i>Types</i></h1>
            <img src="download types.jfif" />

            <p class="para">The term motorcycle has different legal definitions depending on jurisdiction (see § Legal
                definitions and restrictions).

                There are three major types of motorcycle: street, off-road, and dual purpose. Within these types, there
                are many sub-types of motorcycles for different purposes. There is often a racing counterpart to each
                type, such as road racing and street bikes, or motocross including dirt bikes.

                Street bikes include cruisers, sportbikes, scooters and mopeds, and many other types. Off-road
                motorcycles include many types designed for dirt-oriented racing classes such as motocross and are not
                street legal in most areas. Dual purpose machines like the dual-sport style are made to go off-road but
                include features to make them legal and comfortable on the street as well.

                Each configuration offers either specialised advantage or broad capability, and each design creates a
                different riding posture.

                In some countries the use of pillions (rear seats) is restricted</p>
            <br />
            <h1 id="h3"><i>History</i></h1>
            <p class="para">The first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle was the Daimler Reitwagen. It was
                designed and built by the German inventors Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Bad Cannstatt,
                Germany, in 1885.[10] This vehicle was unlike either the safety bicycles or the boneshaker bicycles of
                the era in that it had zero degrees of steering axis angle and no fork offset, and thus did not use the
                principles of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on
                two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.[11]

                The inventors called their invention the Reitwagen ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient
                testbed for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.[12][13]
                Butler's Patent Velocycle
                The first commercial design for a self-propelled cycle was a three-wheel design called the Butler Petrol
                Cycle, conceived of Edward Butler in England in 1884.[14] He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the
                Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1884. The vehicle was built by the Merryweather Fire Engine company in
                Greenwich, in 1888</p>

            <h1 id="h4"><i>Fuel Economy</i></h1>
            <img src="./download fuel.jpg" />

            <p class="para">Motorcycle fuel economy varies greatly with engine displacement and riding style.[44] A
                streamlined, fully faired Matzu Matsuzawa Honda XL125 achieved 470 mpg‑US (0.50 L/100 km; 560 mpg‑imp)
                in the Craig Vetter Fuel Economy Challenge "on real highways – in real conditions".[45] Due to low
                engine displacements (100–200 cc (6.1–12.2 cu in)), and high power-to-mass ratios, motorcycles offer
                good fuel economy. Under conditions of fuel scarcity like 1950s Britain and modern developing nations,
                motorcycles claim large shares of the vehicle market. In the United States, the average motorcycle fuel
                economy is 44 miles per US gallon (19 km per liter)</p>

            <img src="download acc.png" />

            <p class="para">Various features and accessories may be attached to a motorcycle either as OEM
                (factory-fitted) or aftermarket. Such accessories are selected by the owner to enhance the motorcycle's
                appearance, safety, performance, or comfort, and may include anything from mobile electronics to
                sidecars and trailers.</p>
